# CBRS DMS v1.3.1

This is the web client codebase for version 1 of the Coastal Barrier Resources System Determinations Management System (the web services codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/USGS-WiM/cbrsservices_django)). CBRS DMS allows the FWS CBRS team and contractors to enter, query, and manage determinations on whether properties under consideration are in or out of boundaries of federally-designated units, as well as generate reports for completed determinations.

[Angular](https://angular.io/) and generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

#### Installation
*Prerequisite*: Please install Angular-CLI by following [these instructions](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USGS-WiM/cbrsdms.git
cd cbrsdms

# install the project's dependencies
npm install

```

## Environments

The two main environments are configured by environment variables found at `/src/app.settings.ts/`. The API / web services root URL for each environment is stored in these settings.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server with live reload. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This will use the development environment configuration.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Production Build

Run `ng build --prod --base-href /cbrsdms/` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This will use the production environment configuration.
